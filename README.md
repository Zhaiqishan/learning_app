Description: I've written a multi-user interactive learning application using Python in PyCharm. The application needs four modules and a homepage. The four modules are: Question & Answer; Awards; Calender; and Ranking. Users need to log in and register. The software automatically keeps time according to UTC.

Module 1: Question & Answer is a learning and exchange community where users can post questions. Posted questions are displayed with two buttons: Reply and Delete. The Delete button directly removes the question; it's not only available to administrators or the questioner. If a user clicks the Reply button, they can enter their reply in a chat box, which is displayed below the question. A question can accommodate multiple answers. A status bar next to each posted question indicates whether it has been answered. Each posted question can be categorized, and each question is displayed in its corresponding category: Science, Math, Literature, Others, Help, and Emergency. 

Module 2: Awards is an awards section divided into four sections. The top section displays the three awards for the longest study time this month; please suggest three good titles for them. The second section displays the three awards for the shortest study time this month; please suggest three helpful titles for them. The third section has 10 options, displaying ten rewards and penalties, such as: the person with the shortest study time must treat the person with the longest to a meal. Each user can choose three options and can modify them. A checkbox is used to confirm selection. Each option also has a number next to it, representing the number of users who selected that option. The most selected option will be displayed at the top. The last section... The first module is a section for filling in answers. The question is: What new rewards and punishments would you like to add? Users can answer the question, and their answers are recorded in this section.

Module 3: The Calendar module is a calendar and study journal module. Users can freely select each day of each month from 2024 to 2030 in this module. After selection, a box will appear next to it with the words "Study Plan". Users can plan their daily study plan in this section. There is also a button at the bottom right corner of the box, which indicates whether the user has completed the daily study plan. If the user clicks the button, a very bright effect will pop up on the screen and show that the user has completed the daily task.

Module 4: The ranking module is a leaderboard that is refreshed daily. Users can write their name, today's study time, and study content. The person with the longest study time will be placed at the top, and the list will be arranged from highest to lowest. Next to the person with the longest study time, there will be a stamp called "King of Scrolls", the second longest "Scroll Dog", and the third longest "Scroll Thief".
